This app was made with a team formed at Berkeley's 12 hour hackathon HackJam. The application was made with Parse, a very powerful backend system for cloud data. It is an android application and also uses google play's location services. What the app does is the user first logins or registers for an account. That account information and user's location are sent to Parse's database. From there we query the 3 closest people to the user from the database and list their information. The user now has a choice to either contact one of the 3 people to ask for lunch/ dinner or press the button to find other people. Enjoy using the app!
